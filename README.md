# tabular-data-tensorflow
A repository for building, testing, and deploying an regression model for Tensorflow to the Viam registry. From the registry, the script can be used in the Viam custom training scripts flow for training ML models in the Viam cloud. 

## Testing

We test this when you cut a PR by running `scripts/test.sh`. This in turn just runs the model and then runs `pytest` which will run everything in `tests/`. Our testing here isn't overly complex and we have no code coverage or anything so please keep up good hygiene and if you make a change to `training.py` that would requires a test (i.e. you've made a change and you had to manually test something different), add that test condition somewhere to `tests/`

## Workflows

### Pull Request

When you submit a pull request a workflow will run using our [common workflows](https://github.com/viam-modules/common-workflows/) that will lint check your code, build it in the docker image we use in production for training and run the test file you specify.

The default test files is `scripts/test.sh`. If this changes you will need to update `.github/workflows/pull_request.yaml` so that it's

```
jobs:
  build:
    uses: viam-modules/common-workflows/.github/workflows/lint_and_test.yaml
    with:
      test_script_name: NEW_TEST_FILE_NAME
```

### Main

Upon merging to `main` a workflow will automatically update the module in `viam-dev` allowing for people to use your latest changes. The configs you can (but shouldn't!) play with are:
1. framework -- DO NOT CHANGE THIS! This is a tensorflow script and will always be (see: repo name)
2. script_name -- This is what the name will be in the registry. If you change this, it will make a new training script in the registry. Be aware
3. model_type -- unspecified
